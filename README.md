# Project Title
Customer Revenue Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Description
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will generate revenue based on their online shopping behavior. Using data from a CSV file, the project preprocesses the data to extract relevant features and labels. It then trains a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using sensitivity and specificity metrics. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in customer behavior analysis and revenue prediction.
